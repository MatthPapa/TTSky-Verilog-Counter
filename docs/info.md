## How it works

This is an 8-bit binary counter with asynchronous reset, synchronous load and tri-state outputs:

#### Inputs:
- Enable - ena
- Reset - rst_n
- Load Write - uio_in[0]
- Load Data - ui_in[7:0]

#### Outputs:
- Data - uo_out[7:0]

## How to test

Simply run the test.py function! I have pre-made 3 tests to make sure the chip gives the expected output for each function:

#### Test 1:  Reset and Increment
- This first increments then sends n_rst to insure counter resets
- Then increments timer 10 times and ensures increments each time

#### Test 2: TRI-STATE
- Holds the enable pin low and ensure data pins go into HIGH-Z mode

#### Test 3: Load and Wrap Around
- Loads 253 and ensures output is correct
- Increments till 255, and once incremented one more ensures output is 0
- Final test to make sure increments correctly after reset

#### Comparing Pre and Post Layout
Below you can see the full waveform of pre-layout using CocoTB:

Below you can see the full waveform of post-layout using CocoTB:
![PostFull](Bit8C_POST.png "PostFull")

AS you can see there is very minimal changes between the two waveforms meaning my implementation of the 8-bit counter have passed all it's tests!

## External hardware

None, just RTL sim
